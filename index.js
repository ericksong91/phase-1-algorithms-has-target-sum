/* 
  Write the Big O time complexity of your function here

  O(n^2)

*/

/* 
  Add your pseudocode here
  
function load array
  passes array and target to a loop function

function loop array
  loops the array so that every element adds to every other element

  for let i = 0, i < array.length , i++ (i will target array position)
    let j = array.length - 1 (sets its to the end)
     (for let k = 0, j !== i (loop until these are equal), k++
      j = array.length - 1 - k
      if i === j do nothing, else
        if array[i] + array[j] === target
         return true, else loop back)

Essentially a really big nested loop

*/

/*
  Add written explanation of your solution here

  Need to make it so that it checks any combination of two numbers and returns true or false if it equals the second argument (target).

  Using 3 different variables for the two loops that I need. The first loop chooses the first number in the array (going from left to right)
  by maintaining i as a constant during the other loop. The second loop mutates j so that it runs through every other number in the array,
  adding it to i until a solution is found. In the second loop as well, there is a conditional to check for the sum of the arrays at position
  i and j to see if it equals the target. If not found in the second loop, it returns to the first loop and increase i by 1, moving towards
  the next number in the array. 

  An alternate solution i found that is lengthier, is having the variable j move in from the end of the array towards i instead of
  mutating from i onwards.
